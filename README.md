# AoC22
My Advent of Code 2022 solutions.\
Current Stars: **5** :star:

## Files
1.  **Input** includes the input for each day, called 'day<X>.txt'
2.  **Code** includes:\
  The Code for both parts of each day in the same file, called 'day<X>.py' \
  A file containing helper functions that might be useful for multiple days 'helperfunc.py' \
  A template file to use for future code files
  
## Usage
  The code-files take up to two parameters: which part you want to execute and (optional) which input file you want to use.\
  The default value of the input file is the equivalent 'day<X>.txt' file in 'input/'.\
  ```python day<X>.py <1|2> [<input>.txt] ```
